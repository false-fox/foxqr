# foxqr
A no fuss qr code generator, accessible [on my website](https://qr.falsefox.dev). 

Made completely out of spite of other QR Code websites having poor ux, now I always have a good QR code generator available at my fingertips.

## Features
1. The QR code reloads any time a change is made.
2. Several options like resolution, margin, error correction and color.
3. Click on the QR code to download it.
4. Download names are nicely formatted and include a salt to avoid duplicate file names.
5. Public domain under a WTFPL license.
6. 30kb file size.
7. Uses the ``qrcode`` npm package.
